!!!Learner Driver Alert!!!

This repository serves as an archive to my html and css learning journey as I also get to farmiliarize myself with git and github. Two birds with one stone, eh?

The code snipets contained herein may be plagiarized from multiple sources(Think of them as training wheels) with many alterations and errors of my own trial and error. You can also expect many of those (eras* , mitsakes* and bad code)..that is afterall how we all learn.

I make use of a wide repertoire of resources but mainly youtube(Thank Heavens for Youtube) w3chools and the book "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett.
