    <!--Quotes and citations-->
    <p>I am currently rewatching <cite>Death Note</cite> and I do not think I really appreciated it the first time I watched it.</p>
    <p>Here's a random quote by Lawliet from <abbr title="Death Note">DN</abbr> that I googled to use as a blockquote:
    <blockquote cite="https://animemotivation.com/death-note-quotes/">
        â€œIt's not a sense of justice. Figuring out difficult cases is my hobby. If you measured good and evil deeds by current laws, I would be responsible for many crimes. The same way you all like to solve mysteries and riddles, or clear video games more quickly. For me too, it's simply prolonging something I enjoy doing. That's why I only take on cases that pique my interest. It's not justice at all. And if it means being able to clear a case, I don't play fair, I'm a dishonest, cheating human being who hates losing.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Since it is pride month, I read a uote from a random tumblr account that went something like, <q>Men were draped with medals for killing other men yet imprisoned for loving one another.</q> and I haven't seen something that has hit that hard ever since. I would love to know the book it was from, still looking.</p>

    <b>Bluebird</b> <br>
    <i>A poem by Bukowski</i>

    <pre>
        there's a bluebird in my heart that
        wants to get out
        but I'm too tough for him,
        I say, stay in there,
        I'm not going to let anybody see you.
        
        there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
        but I pour whiskey on him and inhale cigarette smoke
        and the whores and the bartenders
        and the grocery clerks
        never know that he's in there.
    </pre>
